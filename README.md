# python-api-challenge

About this Project: Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

The weather API helps us find the connection between a myriad of variables compared to latitude in order to see the differences between the Northern and Sourthern Hemisphere. The following variables compared to latitude are: Temperautre (C), Wind Speed, Cloudiness %, and Humidity %. The completed tasks will be scatter plots and linear regression plots to test for potential relationships between the variables.

The Geoapify API leads us into the second file where we find citiesa cross the globe shown by their Humidity %'s - this is shown on the first map. Secdonly we discover the closest Hotel to each of these coordinates from above. These hotels are listed on the second map. These hotels are found in hte ideal weather condition I chose as: No Clouds.

In the process of creating and finishing this project, I used the Ask BCS tutors, the UofM tutor, the X-pert Learning Assistant, previous in class examples and the following sources:
